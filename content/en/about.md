### **About...My Withered Skill Tree**

**⌨️ Schrödinger's Coding Ability**  
- Python : ███░░░░ (_once max level, now forgotten_)  
- C++/Rust : ██░░░░░ (_writing `int main() {}`/`fn main() {}` counts as victory_)  
- Web Trio : █░░░░░░ (_can create webpages uglier than IE's default interface_)  
- AI Field : ░░░░░░░ (_my GeForce GTX 650 is weeping.jpg_)  

**🏸 Confusing Sports CV**  
- Badminton: Master of "Precision Air Hitting" techniques  
- Stamina: Automatically enters "Near-Death" state after 800m run   

**🎹 Piano Survival Report**  
Pre-2020:  
- Beethoven's *Piano Sonata No.8 in C minor "Pathétique"* (_emotional 1st movement, lightning-speed 3rd movement_)  
- Chopin's *Fantasie-Impromptu* (_smooth right hand runs, left hand accompaniment steady AF_)  
- Liszt's *La Campanella* (_god-tier speed & accuracy combo_)  

Post-2020:  
> _Für Elise → For Physics Teachers: Behold, This is Simple Harmonic Motion_  
> (_can play melodies but music theory knowledge? Gone. Skills? What skills?_)

### **About...My Bizarre Timeline**

**📚 Academic Adventures**  
- 2023~Present: Chengdu No.20 High School's *How to Survive Back-to-Back Core Classes* research project (_math class makes me hallucinate Cantor sets_)  
- 2020~2023: Wuhou Senior High's *108 Sleeping Positions in Backrow SVIP Seats* practical studies (_teachers: "This kid sleeps harder than Schrödinger's cat"_)  
- Primary School Era: Unlocked "6 Years, 2 Schools" hidden achievement (_parents: "We're playing 4D chess here"_)

### **About...My Zizhong Soul**  
- Beef noodle zealot (_"老板儿，二两牛肉面多放红油!"_)  
- Fake Chengdu local who randomly spouts Sichuan-accented Mandarin (_"你suo啥子安？"_)  
- Master of "Bribing Humans with Candied Sweet Potato Strips" (_more corrosive than concentrated sulfuric acid_)

### **About...This Username**  
Obsessed with the coolness of letter X, I mutated from "Spider":  
1. Replaced d with x (_because X marks the mystery spot_)  
2. Changed awkward-ending r to d  
3. Thus `Spixed` was born!  

But grammar checkers keep "fixing" it:  
- "Spider" (_Spiderman: Not my problem_)  
- "Spicy" (_Hot sauce: WTF?_)  
- Even "Speed" (_Fast & Furious: Rude!_)  

TTS bots butcher it too (_AI: "Why would you pronounce /aɪ/ without an e? It's clearly /ɪ/!"_)  
Pro tip: Correctly spelling my ID ≈ Making AI understand dad jokes

### **About...Future Plans**  
- Write code that compilers won't roast by age 25 (_current relationship: mutual disdain_)  
- Achieve elastic collisions between badminton racket & shuttlecock (_Newton's coffin is rattling_)  
- Develop "Summon Takeout with Piano Sounds" tech (_amplitude ∝ fried chicken aroma_)

### **About...Games & Literature**  
🎮 **Digital Snack Guide**  
- Genshin Impact: Nope (_"there's this game I can't uninstall on my phone..."_)  
- Honkai Star Rail: Acheron simp (_lost 50/50 on Sparkle & Jiaoqiu but hey, her blade still slays_)  
  > _"All that was shall sink into nihility, like tears swallowed by the rain."_ — Acheron
- Zenless Zone Zero: Supreme Non-Believer (_pre-pull: "I'll get early 5★!" post-pull: "Hello soft pity my old friend"_)  
- Escape Alive!: Anti-Addiction Warrior (_main account: "Underage Protection MVP"; alt: "Plz carry my noob ass"_)
- PUBG: Human Silhouette Artist (_teammates: "You're totally the enemy spy!"_)  
- Minecraft: Schrödinger's Player (_won't launch unless buddies beg_)  

📖 **Literary "Achievements"**  
- Blush-Inducing Fiction: Majoring in "Will-They-Won't-They Demolition" (_straight & wlw approved, tissues required but purposes questionable_)  
- Three-Body Groupie: Obsessed with hardcore sci-fi (_using dark forest theory to avoid social interactions_)  
- Xianxia 2.0: Recovering power fantasy addict (_now: "Winter's coming, time to bankrupt antagonist corps"_)

### **About...My Playlist**  
🎵 **Music Time Capsule**
- Jay Chou: From _Common Jasmine Orange_ to _Greatest Work_, my DNA's BGM (_but concert tickets are rarer than unicorns_)
- HSR OPs:
  - 2.x _WHITE NIGHT_ (_"Take me away~" looped till roommate filed noise complaint_)
  - 3.x _Nameless Faces_ (_made me cry, looped till my ears grew calluses_)
