# Waves Washing Away - Golden Grains in the Sand Sea

---

The great river meanders, lonely clouds roll the leaves in the wind, and one person sifts through the sand in the middle of the river.

Eighteen years, sifting out a body and a soul.

The road here was long, the road ahead is long. I have arrived here, but I do not know where I belong. I compare myself to a passing traveler, an ephemeral mayfly for half a day, like dust falling into water.

Stepping into the chaos, distinguishing the dullness and leaving on my own; looking into the distance, but coming with disappointment.

I entrust my sincere feelings to this, expressing various things in poetry, vainly hoping to leave a shocking sentence...

But alas, my talent is shallow and my learning is sparse, my experience is meager. Regretting my lack of achievement, I often recall my past for a long time and tears flow. Finally, this collection "Gold in the Sand" is completed...

Perhaps I have also deceived myself, chasing an impossible goal, even if I have given up many similar possibilities because of it...

I have also wondered whether people should be happy or whether they should be in pain; and who am I? Later, when a group of people left me one by one (or did I leave them?)

I completely proved - I am not needed. Of course, this is not a bad thing.

My choices can be borne by myself, and I will practice them.

My regrets are no longer tears in my eyes, but dust behind me. Cocooning oneself can also lead to breaking out of the cocoon and rebirth. I do not accept a life of shrinking back.

My eyes should not only contain fear, even if memories cannot shine into reality...

How much do you have to pay to buy the future? I'm afraid the answer doesn't exist.

An imperfect life is also worth looking forward to...

I will be reborn under death,

And become strong when I am cowardly.

When the tide of oblivion swallows people's memories, only by pressing the shutter and writing down romantic stories can we remember...

Romance is: whether it is destruction, emptiness, or oblivion, it is a magnificent moment...

If you are not willing to give up what you cherish, then how can you exchange for items with a heavy price...

What exactly have I forgotten?

On the boundless wheat field, I collected grains of wheat along the way——

The teacher told me to pick the biggest one. Some classmates picked the first ear, some took the last branch; some regretted, some rejoiced... Here, someone walked through the wheat field without reaching out a hand. He always hesitated whether he was worthy or whether he should keep it.

He suffered from loneliness, but witnessed various forms of life.

He is a guest in the human world...

---

On the wheat field filled with gold, I worked day and night——

The old man once left a joke about burying gold. Some people gave up the so-called scam, some placed their hopes on eternal gold. In this fertile soil, some people rejoiced, some were distressed. And there was one person who neither had hope nor left.

He went through hardships and created the epic of the golden wilderness.

He is a disillusioned long dream...

---

By the wheat field on the cliff, I watched on the edge——

Fearing that children would fall into the abyss, but unable to bear the meaninglessness of powerless dissuasion. On the watcher's wheat field,

He witnessed the romance of those who went to death and remembered humanity.

He wrote the story...

On the earth full of fables,

I have walked through eighteen years of spring and autumn.

I thought I had experienced all four seasons,

The recovery and vitality of spring just went away;

The hard fight of summer came quietly;

The harvest of autumn has not been seen in time;

The winter snow left and was never seen again.

There are countless four seasons in life. We countless times: prepare, give, harvest, taste...

In the end, what we are too late for and cannot let go of

Is the original self - sincere, simple, dreaming.

The so-called impossible things are just things that have not yet arrived.

I once prayed for death in my dreams, but lived in fear and expectation.

I heard countless questions, interrogations, rhetorical questions, and doubts: What is the meaning of life?

Just because life eventually returns to death, that final ending that life cannot shake, so life has no meaning... right? Someone is eager to end a meaningless life. He is not willing to fail again, a failure that cannot achieve the goal. Even if the destination he arrived at smoothly is just an isolated island full of sadness and regret.

But every life shares a common ending, so all the complex selectivity in the process of life can be counted as meaning. Finding a goal in life counts as a meaning. Resisting meaning is the conspiracy under the umbrella of "meaninglessness". Moreover, this meaning is not interest and benefit.

No matter how mythology and science discuss life - the meaning of life lies in - δ-me13, in the process of solving for the self.

A thunder that will eventually shake the clear sky and pierce the rainbow——

The mayfly shakes the tree, the roc goes north;

The shore of the netherworld, the falling moon and the moths rushing to the fire;

A drunken guest in a foreign land, a dream of a thousand miles.

---

The road ahead:

Is the love for mathematics and logic,

The appreciation of poetry and art,

A fearless dream,

Cutting off the emptiness of the past,

Single-minded restraint,

No longer telling lies to myself,

The determination to make a prompt decision,

And an unfulfilled promise of mine...

Inadvertently, ushered in my eighteenth year.

It is the first and most brilliant burning of this rising sun.

Wish me a calm journey - a dreaming ephemeral traveler.
